Train Simulation with 0/1 Knapsack Algorithm

This project combines a graphical simulation of a train moving on a track with the implementation of the 0/1 knapsack algorithm. The algorithm is used to solve a classic problem in combinatorial optimization, where a set of items with weights and values are selected to maximize the total value within a limited capacity.
The simulation displays two trains moving on a track, with the background scenery and train designs created using graphics libraries. The 0/1 knapsack algorithm is integrated into the project, allowing users to input values and weights for a set of items and calculate the maximum value that can be obtained within a given capacity.


The project showcases the application of dynamic programming in solving real-world optimization problems, while also demonstrating the use of graphics libraries in creating engaging visual simulations. The combination of these two elements makes for an interactive and informative project that highlights the importance of algorithms in solving complex problems.
